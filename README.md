Trigger Tool for D2


Here is a little script I've put together for Division 2. I know some people will find it useful. It's good for other games too. (Not the triggerbot part obviously).

Features:

Adjustable Anti-Recoil - - Adjustable anti-recoil. Can be adjusted on the fly via hotkeys left/right as well as up/down. Anti-recoil also works for triggerbot and autofire modes. 

Autotrigger - - Activates when crosshair is red. Works great for rifles if you tweak the recoil and shot timing correctly. YOU MUST CONFIGURE "J" AS A FIRE KEY IN GAME TO USE THE AUTOFIRE/AUTOTRIGGER (or edit the script)

Adjustable Autofire - - Press Mouse4 (can be changed in AHK) to automatically fire semi auto weapons. You can press O/Ctrl-O to turn up/down the delay by 25 ms increments. (If you leave the delay at 0, then semi auto weapons will not repeat fire. This is good for full auto weapons combined with triggerbot, because they will automatically stop firing when crosshair is off enemies, and resume firing again if you aim at them without having to take your finger off the key. You need to turn up the duration with O / Ctrl-O if you want to autofire. By default it is full auto.

All 3 of these features are able to be combined 

YOU MUST CONFIGURE "J" AS A FIRE KEY IN GAME TO USE THE AUTOFIRE/AUTOTRIGGER or rebind it in the script

Controls:

F3: Turn script on and off. Good to use because the anti recoil makes clicking things annoying. (Pretty sure there's actually an easy way to fix that so it auto activates, just haven't yet.)

F4: Toggle "Autofire". By default Mouse4 will only fire when crosshair is red. This switches it to autofire mode. 

Mouse-4 Activate Triggerbot/Autofire, depending on if you have "Autofire" BIND J AS ALTERNATE FIRE KEY

Numpad Plus / Numpad Minus: Increase/decrease upwards recoil compensation.

CTRL+Numpad Plus / CTRL+Numpad Minus: Adjust left/right recoil compensation. Very useful for some of the weapons in Division 2.

O / Ctrl+O: Adjust the duration between autofire/triggerbot shots. By default this is at 0, which means that you will not repeat fire (default setting intended for full auto)


Let me know if you guys have any questions or issues, or if you're really desperate for me to change the hotkeys or something.
